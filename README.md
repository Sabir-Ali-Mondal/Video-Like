# VIDEO-LIKE

**Create code-based videos for clear and structured learning. No fake AI graphics, just real code.**

VIDEO-LIKE is an Auto Video Creator that utilizes frontend web technologies and text-generating AI. 

It is a simple but powerful browser application that takes structured JSON data and turns it into narrated videos. It runs entirely inside a **single HTML file**.

This project bridges the gap between data and storytelling. It helps developers, teachers, marketers, and analysts make data-rich videos (featuring live charts, interactive maps, and coding art) without using heavy, complex, or expensive video editing software.

### The Philosophy
Video-Like is a browser-based rendering engine designed for structured visual learning. It rejects hallucinated AI video in favor of real DOM manipulation, WebGL data visualization, and scripted logic, outputting deterministic, cinematic educational content.

### Application Summary

*   **JSON to Video Pipeline:** Write or generate a JSON script, and the engine instantly renders it as a live, animated video presentation directly in the DOM.
*   **The AI Architect:** A built-in AI co-director researches topics, generates complete video projects from scratch, and iteratively improves your current code based on your feedback.
*   **Flawless Built-in Export:** A custom intelligent rendering pipeline safely crops out browser toolbars, captures the live canvas, and downloads a high-quality HD video file.
*   **Auto-Subtitles:** As the video renders, the engine tracks the text-to-speech timing and automatically generates a perfectly synced `.srt` subtitle file.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** No servers, no build steps, no installations. Everything from the UI to the rendering engine is contained in one file.
