This is the best approach. Since LLMs have output limits, asking for 56 high-quality scenes in one go will result in simple, boring code.

To get **broadcast-quality visuals**, you must generate them in **batches of 5-7 scenes**.

Here is your **Master Prompt Strategy**.

### 🛑 STEP 1: The "Director" Context (Paste this first)
*Before generating any batch, paste this into the AI so it knows the "Rules of Cinema" for your engine.*

> **SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:**
> You are a High-End Motion Graphics Engineer. You are writing JSON data for a web-based video engine.
>
> **THE ENGINE RULES:**
> 1.  **Structure:** Output strictly valid JSON matching the `DEMO_DATA` format.
> 2.  **Visuals:** Use Tailwind CSS. ALL scenes must use these specific cinematic classes:
>     *   `.film-grain` (Overlay texture)
>     *   `.camera-drift` (Slow zoom/pan animation)
>     *   `.marker-highlight` with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` (for text)
>     *   `.scan-line` (for tech scenes)
>     *   `mix-blend-mode` (overlay, screen, difference) for compositing.
> 3.  **Scripts:** Use `(ctx) => { ... }`.
>     *   For Canvas/Math: Use `new p5(p => {...}, container)`.
>     *   For Charts: Use `ctx.chart(id, config)`.
>     *   For Maps: Use `ctx.map(id, config)`.
> 4.  **Quality:** NO static HTML. Everything must move. Use `requestAnimationFrame`, CSS animations, or library callbacks.
> 5.  **Output:** Return ONLY the `scenes` array content (comma separated objects), so I can copy-paste them into my master file.

### 🎬 BATCH 1: Cinematic Openers & Typography
*Focus: High-impact text, lighting effects, and intro sequences.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **CINEMATIC TYPOGRAPHY BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes:
>
> 1.  **TITLE_CINEMATIC:** A black screen. Huge text reveals slowly with a blur-to-focus effect. A subtle "god ray" light sweep animation passes over the text.
> 2.  **KINETIC_TYPE:** Fast-paced, rhythmic text. Giant words flash big/small in sync with a beat. High contrast (Black/White).
> 3.  **GLITCH_TEXT:** Cyberpunk style. Text separates into RGB channels (red/blue offset), jitters, random characters decode into the final title.
> 4.  **QUOTE_SCENE:** A serif quote on an aged paper background (`.texture-paper`). As the narration speaks, a yellow highlighter (`.marker-highlight`) draws over the key words realistically.
> 5.  **SPOTLIGHT:** Pitch black screen. A flashlight beam (CSS radial gradient) moves around revealing parts of a hidden headline or image underneath.
> 6.  **NEON_SIGN:** A dark brick wall background. Text flickers on like a broken neon sign, buzzing, then stays fully lit with a heavy glow/bloom effect.
> 7.  **PARALLAX_LAYER:** Foreground elements (clouds/dust) move fast, mid-ground (text) moves slow, background (city) moves very slow. Mouse movement (if possible) or auto-drift affects perspective.

### 📊 BATCH 2: Data Visualization & Charts
*Focus: Chart.js magic, dynamic updates, and "Bloomberg Terminal" aesthetics.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **DATA VIZ BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes using `ctx.chart`:
>
> 1.  **NEON_DATA_CRASH:** A line chart representing a stock market. It rises green, hits a peak, then crashes red vertically. Background turns red when it crashes.
> 2.  **KPI_CASCADE:** 3 big statistic cards. They slide in one by one. The numbers count up (0 to 100%) rapidly using a JS loop.
> 3.  **DOUGHNUT_HOLO:** A futuristic 3D-looking doughnut chart. It spins. The center displays the percentage. Glowing segments.
> 4.  **TIMELINE_SCROLL:** A horizontal timeline. As the script plays, the timeline scrolls left. Years pop up. The active year gets a circle pulse effect.
> 5.  **BAR_RACE:** A vertical bar chart comparing 3 countries. The bars grow and shrink dynamically via a script function call `updateData()` to simulate changing stats over time.
> 6.  **STOCK_TICKER:** A scrolling marquee at the bottom (like CNN). Main screen shows a "Buy/Sell" gauge needle swinging wildly.
> 7.  **HEATMAP_GRID:** A grid of 100 small squares. They pulse different colors (heat map style) randomly. A crosshair target moves to select one specific square.

### 🌍 BATCH 3: Geography & Networks
*Focus: Leaflet maps, SVG connections, and "Detective Board" vibes.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **GEO & NETWORK BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes:
>
> 1.  **SATELLITE_ZOOM:** Use Leaflet. Start at global zoom (World). Script `flyTo` zooms down rapidly to a specific city (e.g., Tokyo). Overlay grid lines.
> 2.  **NETWORK_NODES:** 20 dots bouncing around (Canvas/p5). Lines draw between them if they get close. Simulates a neural network or virus spread.
> 3.  **DETECTIVE_BOARD:** A corkboard texture. Photos are scattered. An SVG path (Red String) animates, drawing itself from Pin A to Pin B to Pin C.
> 4.  **GLOBAL_CABLES:** A dark map of the world. Glowing curved lines (SVG) draw arcs connecting continents (Submarine cables).
> 5.  **SERVER_FARM:** An image of servers. Overlay twinkling green lights on the racks. A "Data Upload" progress bar fills up in the foreground.
> 6.  **MAP_PINS:** A stylized dark map. Pins drop down from the sky (CSS bounce). When a pin lands, a radar ripple expands from it.
> 7.  **AURORA_WAVES:** Abstract flowing colors (p5.js noise) resembling the Northern Lights or data streams flowing across the screen.

### 🧬 BATCH 4: Abstract & Generative (Science/Tech)
*Focus: p5.js, canvas manipulation, physics simulation.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **GENERATIVE SCIENCE BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes using `ctx.p5`:
>
> 1.  **DNA_HELIX:** A double helix spinning. Made of dots (particles). It rotates slowly in 3D space.
> 2.  **PARTICLE_EXPLOSION:** Dots start at center. On a specific step trigger, they explode outward with physics and slowly fade (Big Bang simulation).
> 3.  **MATRIX_RAIN:** Green katakana/code rain falling vertically. High contrast black background.
> 4.  **LIQUID_WAVEFORM:** A smooth sine wave that animates like liquid audio visualization. It reacts to amplitude (simulated).
> 5.  **BLACK_HOLE:** A black circle in the center with an "Accretion Disk" of orange particles spinning into it. Distortion effect.
> 6.  **SWARM_AI:** Hundreds of tiny "boids" (triangles) that flock together like birds or fish. They follow a target mouse or point.
> 7.  **CELL_MITOSIS:** A blob (organic shape) that wobbles, elongates, and splits into two separate circles.

### 📱 BATCH 5: UI & Simulation (The "Screen recording" look)
*Focus: DOM layouts, fake interfaces, newspaper layouts.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **UI & SIMULATION BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes:
>
> 1.  **NEWSPAPER_SPIN:** An old newspaper spins in from zero scale to full screen. The headline highlights yellow.
> 2.  **CHAT_CONV:** An iMessage/WhatsApp style interface. Bubbles pop in: "Typing..." -> "Message 1" -> "Reply".
> 3.  **CODE_TERMINAL:** A black window. Green text types out character by character (`code.innerHTML += char`). It runs a "hacking" sequence.
> 4.  **BROWSER_SEARCH:** A fake Google search bar. Text types "Why is AI dangerous?". Results fade in. Mouse cursor moves to click top result.
> 5.  **SOCIAL_POST:** A Twitter/X or Instagram card. The "Like" counter rolls up rapidly from 0 to 10,000. Heart icon pulses red.
> 6.  **NOTIFICATIONS:** A glass-morphism mobile screen. Notifications slide down from the top one by one, stacking up. "System Alert".
> 7.  **VIDEO_PLAYER:** A fake YouTube player frame. A "Play" button is clicked, and a progress bar starts moving. Comments scroll up on the side.

### 🧩 BATCH 6: Advanced Layouts
*Focus: Comparison, Quizzes, and complex HTML structures.*

**PROMPT:**
> Generate the **ADVANCED LAYOUTS BATCH**. Create detailed JSON for these 7 scenes:
>
> 1.  **SPLIT_COMPARISON:** Screen divided 50/50. Left is "Old Tech" (Grayscale), Right is "New Tech" (Color). A slider moves back and forth revealing them.
> 2.  **PROCESS_STEPS:** 4 icons in a row. An arrow animates from Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3. The active step glows.
> 3.  **QUIZ_GAME:** A question appears. 4 options below. After 2 seconds, the wrong ones fade out, the right one turns Green and pulses.
> 4.  **TREE_DIAGRAM:** An organizational chart. Top node appears. Lines draw down to child nodes. They pop in sequentially.
> 5.  **PROS_CONS:** Two columns. Green checks animate in on the left. Red Xs animate in on the right.
> 6.  **CAROUSEL_3D:** 3 Images arranged in a 3D carousel. They rotate. The center one is big, side ones are small/blurred.
> 7.  **EXPLODED_VIEW:** An image of a phone or machine. The layers (screen, battery, chip) separate vertically (CSS transform Y) to show what's inside.

### 📝 How to Assemble

1.  Open your code editor.
2.  Create a variable `const ALL_SCENES = [];`
3.  Run each prompt above in your AI chat.
4.  Copy the output (the array of objects) and paste them into your list.
5.  Finally, assign `DEMO_DATA.scenes = ALL_SCENES;`

This strategy forces the AI to dedicate its entire "brain power" to just 7 scenes at a time, allowing for complex p5.js scripts and detailed CSS animations for every single one.
